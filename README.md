- **Environment Variables**: dotenv


## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **MongoDB**
- **Insomnia or Postman** (for testing API endpoints, optional)

## Environment Variables
The environment variables are set up in a .env file 

## Usage
1.	Start the server in development mode with nodemon: *npm run dev*
